# One Time Pad

This is a one time pad that can be used to generate a random pad, encode the message, and encrypt the message. It can also be used to decode and decrypt the message.

For encoding and decoding, it makes use of a code book to shorten the message.

It's not intended to be used over the internet, just as an aid if one wants to create a one time pad using open source code.
